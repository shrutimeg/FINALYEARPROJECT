        <h2>What is CKD</h2>
        <div class="content">
        
        <p>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a progressive condition where the kidneys gradually lose their ability to
            function properly. It can lead to complications such as high blood pressure, anemia, and kidney
            failure.Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, involves a gradual loss of kidney
            function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then removed in your
            urine. Advanced chronic kidney disease can cause dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes to build
            up in your body Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) is a long-term medical condition characterized by the gradual
            loss of kidney function over time. The kidneys are essential organs that filter waste products and excess
            fluids from the blood, which are then excreted in the urine. When kidney function declines, it can lead to
            the accumulation of waste products and fluids in the body, causing various health issues.
            CKD is defined by a decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) or evidence of kidney damage (such as protein
            in the urine) lasting for at least three months.

        <h2>Common Causes and Risk Factors</h2>

        <p>Common causes of CKD include diabetes, high blood pressure, and certain kidney conditions. Risk factors
            that increase the likelihood of developing CKD include age, family history, obesity, smoking, and
            certain ethnic backgrounds.
            Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) can have various causes and risk factors that contribute to its development.
            Here's a breakdown of some common causes and risk factors:

            Diabetes Mellitus: Diabetes is one of the leading causes of CKD. High blood sugar levels over time can
            damage the small blood vessels in the kidneys, leading to kidney disease.

            Hypertension (High Blood Pressure): High blood pressure can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys,
            reducing their ability to function properly. CKD and hypertension often coexist and can worsen each other's
            effects.

            Family History: A family history of kidney disease or related conditions can increase the risk of developing
            CKD. Certain genetic factors may predispose individuals to kidney problems.


            Smoking: Tobacco use is a significant risk factor for CKD. Smoking can damage blood vessels throughout the
            body, including those in the kidneys, leading to impaired kidney function over time.

            Older Age: The risk of CKD increases with age. As people get older, the kidneys may undergo structural
            changes and become less efficient at filtering waste products from the blood.


            

            Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs): Chronic or recurrent urinary tract infections can lead to kidney damage if
            left untreated. UTIs can cause inflammation and scarring of the kidneys over time.

    <h2>Precautions</h2>
            <p>To prevent or manage CKD, it is important to control blood sugar levels, maintain healthy blood pressure,
                eat a balanced diet, stay active, avoid smoking, and get regular kidney function tests if you are at
                risk.
                Living with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) requires careful management and specific precautions to
                maintain kidney function and overall health. Here are essential steps and tips to help manage CKD
                effectively:
               Dietary Management
                Limit Protein Intake
                Stop smoking
                Limit alcohol intake

                Maintain a healthy weight, reduce salt intake, exercise regularly, and avoid smoking. These actions can
                help keep your blood pressure in check.

                If you have diabetes, keeping your blood sugar levels within target ranges is crucial. 

                Regular blood and urine tests are essential to monitor your kidney function, electrolytes, and other
                vital parameters. Stay on top of scheduled tests.
                Frequent Check-ups
                Infection Prevention,practice good hygiene.

                CKD can weaken your immune system, making you more susceptible to infections. 
                 
                


                Regular physical activity can help control blood pressure and manage weight. 
                By following these precautions and working closely with your healthcare team, you can help slow the
                progression of CKD and maintain a better quality of life.
